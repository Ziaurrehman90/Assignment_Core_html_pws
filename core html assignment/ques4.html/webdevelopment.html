    <h4 >What is Web Development ?</h4>
     <p>Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser.<br> It may, however, also include web design, web programming, and database management.</p>
     <p>Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of apps (web design).<br>The term development is usually reserved for the actual construction of these things (that is to say, the programming of sites).</p>
    <p>The basic tools involved in web development are programming languages called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript.<br> There are, however, a number of other programs used to “manage” or facilitate the construction of sites that would otherwise have to be done “from scratch” by writing code.<br> A number of content management systems (CMS) fall into this category, including WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, TYPO3, and Adobe Experience Manager, among others.</p>
